title: Pages with EJS and JSON

<h1>Using EJS</h1>
<h2>Layouts</h2>
<p>Your layout is a mix between HTML and EJS. In your layouts you can include any number of files
  you defined in your <code>partials</code> directory. The only real constraint you have when creating layouts is
  all the content that is defined in your you are going to render has to go inside the following EJS tag:
</p>
<p class = 'text-center'><span><code><%%- body %></code></span></p>

<h2>Creating Pages Using EJS</h2>
<p>Aside from creating the layouts, you can also use EJS 
  to create pages. This way you can embed conditionals and variables
  into your pages. For example, these are some variables.
  Site title: <%= site.title %>
  Page Title: <%= page.title %></p>

<h2>JSON</h2>

<p>You can use JSON to pass data to a page created using EJS and 
  render the data. You just have to expose the JSON data to the <code>site.config</code> file.
  This is done by requiring the data file inside <code>site.config</code> and adding it 
  to the exported object.
  The data below is coming from a JSON file.</p>

<h2>All things BBQ!</h2>
<ul>
  <% site.projects.map((project) => { %>
    <h1><%= project.title %></h1>
    <li><a href="<%= project.url %>" target = '_blank'><%= project.name %></a></li>
  <% }) %>
</ul>
