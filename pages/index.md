Welcome to MrHyde SSG. This a simple example on how to use _MrHyde_ to create static pages.
We use [EJS](https://github.com/mde/ejs) as our templating engine. Conten can be written in EJS, Markdown,
plain HTML or JSON.
This page, for example, is created using Markdown.
Make sure to look at the docs to get a better feel of how to use _MrHyde_.
Also, you can look at the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to get a better feel on how to use _Markdown_. You are also welcome to the [following](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) [tutorials](https://moz.com/blog/markdown) in order to understand how _Markdown_ translates to _HTML_.
